# SocialMediaLieBounty

# Problem Statement
Social media benefits includes expanding ones social networks and keeping users in touch with peers and far-away friends and family. Social media is active 24/7, millions of users, every user is a potential author, any user can post opinions, share other people's opinions/comments etc. Through social media, news and events happening in any part of the world becomes only a click away or received as an alert. This development has its downside as there are no set down rules or means to filter truth from lies or discourage the peddling of fake news. See references.

 

In this project, your task is to define a 'net' or 'filter' to detect lies on social media. To keep things simple, you can decide to work on any of the social media platforms. Your project should collect data from the preferred social media platform and test your hypothesis for results. Your testing procedure could be live too.
